# Underworld Ascendant: A Criminal Empire Simulator

## Overview

Welcome to *Underworld Ascendant*, a deep, strategic management and simulation game where players build, manage, and defend a criminal empire from the ground up. This project is the frontend dashboard for the game, providing a top-down, data-driven view of your operations. It blends elements of grand strategy, resource management, and character progression within a dynamic urban environment. The core experience emphasizes player choice, consequence, and emergent gameplay through complex, interconnected systems, powered by the Google Gemini API for dynamic, unique content generation.

## Core Features

-   **Dynamic Scenario Generation:** Every game starts with a unique, AI-generated storyline, starting resources, crew, and territorial control, ensuring no two playthroughs are the same.

-   **Rule-Based World Events:** The city reacts to your actions with rule-based events like police crackdowns and economic booms or recessions, forcing you to adapt your strategy.

## Visual Style & Aesthetics

The game features a gritty, atmospheric 'Noir-Steampunk' blend, set in a stylized 1920s-1940s industrial urban landscape. The UI is clean, intuitive, and thematically integrated, resembling old paper documents, industrial schematics, or vintage switchboards, prioritizing clarity for complex data.
